# Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Federated Data Service

## V1.1.0 Release Notes


The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is excited to announce the release of version 1.1.0 of the Data Federation Resource API (https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/). This update enhances the API’s functionality by introducing additional metadata fields — Anatomic Site, Specimen Molecular Analyte Type, Library Source Material, Library Selection Method — to improve data search capabilities.  

### API Overview 

The Data Federation Resource API enables users to search data from various resources as if querying a single virtual database. Data remains in its original location and is not moved or centrally warehoused, allowing users to access it directly where it resides.  

Current members include the Kids First Data Resource Center, Pediatric Cancer Data Commons, St. Jude Cloud, and Treehouse Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. Data access processes adhere to the policies of each contributing resource. These resources provide information on genomic, clinical, imaging, and biospecimen data. The list of participating organizations will continue to grow as more contributors implement CCDI’s federation data API. 

### Data Harmonization
Metadata has been harmonized to Common Data Elements (CDEs) to standardize attributes and allowable values and are registered in the Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR)(https://cadsr.cancer.gov).

- Age data: Some values have been converted from years to days and should not be interpreted as exact values.
- Diagnosis values: incorporate terms from various classifications (CNS Diagnosis Category, ICD-0 3.2, and WHO CNS5), leveraging Uberon ontology (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon).
- Harmonized diagnosis values provided by Federation members may not always perfectly align with the original data. Users are advised to review unharmonized values or contact the respective data provider for additional clarification.
